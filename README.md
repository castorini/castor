# Castor

This is the common repo for PyTorch deep learning models by the Data Systems Group at the University of Waterloo.

## Setting up PyTorch

**If you are an internal Castor contributor using GPU machines in the lab, follow the instructions [here](./docs/internal-instructions.md).**

Castor is designed for Python 3.6 and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) 0.4.
PyTorch recommends [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) for managing your environment.
We'd recommend creating a custom environment as follows:

```
$ conda create --name castor python=3.6
$ source activate castor
```

And installing the packages as follows:

```
$ conda install pytorch torchvision -c pytorch
```

Other Python packages we use can be installed via pip:

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Code depends on data from NLTK (e.g., stopwords) so you'll have to download them. Run the Python interpreter and type the commands:

```python
>>> import nltk
>>> nltk.download()
```

Finally, run the following inside the `utils` directory to build the `trec_eval` tool for evaluating certain datasets.

```bash
$ ./get_trec_eval.sh
```

## Data and Pre-Trained Models

**If you are an internal Castor contributor using GPU machines in the lab, follow the instructions [here](./docs/internal-instructions.md).**

To fully take advantage of code here, clone these other two repos:

+ [`Castor-data`](https://git.uwaterloo.ca/jimmylin/Castor-data): embeddings, datasets, etc.
+ [`Caster-models`](https://git.uwaterloo.ca/jimmylin/Castor-models): pre-trained models

Organize your directory structure as follows:

```
.
├── Castor
├── Castor-data
└── Castor-models
```

For example (using HTTPS):

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/castorini/Castor.git
$ git clone https://git.uwaterloo.ca/jimmylin/Castor-data.git
$ git clone https://git.uwaterloo.ca/jimmylin/Castor-models.git
```

After cloning the Castor-data repo, you need to unzip embeddings and run data pre-processing scripts. You can choose
to follow instructions under each dataset and embedding directory separately, or just run the following script in Castor-data
to do all of the steps for you:

```bash
$ ./setup.sh
```
