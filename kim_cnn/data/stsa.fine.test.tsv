3	one of the most haunting , viciously honest coming-of-age films in recent memory .
4	the film has just enough of everything -- re-enactments , archival footage , talking-head interviews -- and the music is simply sublime .
4	i like the new footage and still love the old stuff .

4	gollum 's ` performance ' is incredible !
3	superior genre storytelling , which gets under our skin simply by crossing the nuclear line .
1	there are films that try the patience of even the most cinema-besotted critic -- and this was one of them .
3	an unabashedly schmaltzy and thoroughly enjoyable true story .
1	if this dud had been made in the '70s , it would have been called the hills have antlers and played for about three weeks in drive-ins .
3	a deliciously mordant , bitter black comedy .
1	a sophomoric exploration of ` life problems ' most people solved long ago -- or at least got tired of hearing people kvetch about .

2	just one problem : fish out of water usually die .
2	some actors steal scenes .
4	this warm and gentle romantic comedy has enough interesting characters to fill several movies , and its ample charms should win over the most hard-hearted cynics .
1	half of it is composed of snappy patter and pseudo-sophisticated cultural observations , while the remainder ... would be more at home on a daytime television serial .
1	though howard demonstrates a great eye as a director , this southern gothic drama is sadly a tough sit , with an undeveloped narrative and enough flashbacks and heavy-handed metaphors to choke a horse -- or at least slow him down to a canter .
3	a tough go , but leigh 's depth and rigor , and his skill at inspiring accomplished portrayals that are all the more impressive for their lack of showiness , offsets to a notable degree the film 's often-mined and despairing milieu .

4	a charming romantic comedy that is by far the lightest dogme film and among the most enjoyable .
3	while the isle is both preposterous and thoroughly misogynistic , its vistas are incredibly beautiful to look at .
4	denis and co-writer michele petin 's impeccable screenplay penetrates with a rawness that that is both unflinching and tantalizing .
1	expect to be reminded of other , better films , especially seven , which director william malone slavishly copies .
4	lathan and diggs have considerable personal charm , and their screen rapport makes the old story seem new .
3	the reason this picture works better than its predecessors is that myers is no longer simply spoofing the mini-mod-madness of '60s spy movies .

1	dialogue-heavy and too cerebral for its own good -- or , at any rate , too cerebral for its racy subject matter .
4	when it 's all wet , blue crush is highly enjoyable .
2	a ponderous meditation on love that feels significantly longer than its relatively scant 97 minutes .
3	a somewhat crudely constructed but gripping , questing look at a person so racked with self-loathing , he becomes an enemy to his own race .
1	usually when i get this much syrup , i like pancakes to go with it .
3	mr. wedge and mr. saldanha handle the mix of verbal jokes and slapstick well .

3	but fans should have fun meeting a brand-new pokemon called celebi .
1	son of the bride may be a good half-hour too long but comes replete with a flattering sense of mystery and quietness .
1	it 's laughing at us .
2	haynes has so fanatically fetishized every bizarre old-movie idiosyncrasy with such monastic devotion you 're not sure if you should applaud or look into having him committed .
1	like most sequels , it takes what worked last time , repeats it and adds more characters , more stunts , more stuff in attempt to camouflage its sameness .
1	this film 's relationship to actual tension is the same as what christmas-tree flocking in a spray can is to actual snow : a poor -- if durable -- imitation .
1	helmer devito ... attempts to do too many things in this story about ethics , payola , vice , murder , kids ' tv and revenge .
1	the humor is hinged on the belief that knees in the crotch , elbows in the face and spit in the eye are inherently funny .

1	a shambles of a movie -- visually unattractive , unbearably loud and utterly silly ... its hilarity is completely unintentional .
3	its direction , its script , and weaver 's performance as a vaguely discontented woman of substance make for a mildly entertaining 77 minutes , if that 's what you 're in the mood for .
3	it is so refreshing to see robin williams turn 180 degrees from the string of insultingly innocuous and sappy fiascoes he 's been making for the last several years .

1	still , this thing feels flimsy and ephemeral .
4	a blessed gift to film geeks and historians .
3	what jackson has accomplished here is amazing on a technical level .
4	it should be mentioned that the set design and interiors of the haunted vessel are more than effectively creepy and moodily lit .

2	this 72-minute film does have some exciting scenes , but it 's a tad slow .
2	it will probably prove interesting to ram dass fans , but to others it may feel like a parody of the mellow , peace-and-love side of the '60s counterculture .
1	mark me down as a non-believer in werewolf films that are not serious and rely on stupidity as a substitute for humor .
3	maguire is a surprisingly effective peter\/spider-man .
3	windtalkers is shapelessly gratifying , the kind of movie that invites you to pick apart its faults even as you have to admit that somehow it hit you where you live .
4	for its seriousness , high literary aspirations and stunning acting , the film can only be applauded .
1	so clichéd that , at one point , they literally upset an apple cart .

0	what will , most likely , turn out to be the most repellent movie of 2002 .
1	a little too pat for its own good .
1	the story is familiar from its many predecessors ; like them , it eventually culminates in the not-exactly - stunning insight that crime does n't pay .
1	even legends like alfred hitchcock and john huston occasionally directed trifles ... so it 's no surprise to see a world-class filmmaker like zhang yimou behind the camera for a yarn that 's ultimately rather inconsequential .
3	if nothing else , this movie introduces a promising , unusual kind of psychological horror .
0	a sermonizing and lifeless paean to teenage dullards .
1	for all its highfalutin title and corkscrew narrative , the movie turns out to be not much more than a shaggy human tale .
0	had anyone here done anything remotely intelligent , we all could have stopped watching long ago .
3	a teasing drama whose relentless good-deed\/bad-deed reversals are just interesting enough to make a sinner like me pray for an even more interesting , less symmetrical , less obviously cross-shaped creation .

3	an unbelievably fun film just a leading man away from perfection .
0	extremely dumb .
2	in the end , ted bundy 's only justification is the director 's common but unexplored fascination with the frustrated maniac ; there 's no larger point , and little social context .

0	leave these flowers unpicked -- they 're dead on the vine .
1	when the plot kicks in , the film loses credibility .
3	may be spoofing an easy target -- those old ' 50 's giant creature features -- but ... it acknowledges and celebrates their cheesiness as the reason why people get a kick out of watching them today .

4	think of it as a sort of comfort food for the mind .
4	hilarious , acidic brit comedy .
3	an incredibly clever and superbly paced caper filled with scams within scams within scams .
1	myers never knows when to let a gag die ; thus , we 're subjected to one mind-numbingly lengthy riff on poo and pee jokes after another .
