# kim_cnn

Implementation for Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification of [Kim (2014)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1408.5882) with PyTorch and Torchtext.

## Model Type

- rand: All words are randomly initialized and then modified during training.
- static: A model with pre-trained vectors from [word2vec](https://code.google.com/archive/p/word2vec/). All words -- including the unknown ones that are initialized with zero -- are kept static and only the other parameters of the model are learned.
- non-static: Same as above but the pretrained vectors are fine-tuned for each task.
- multichannel: A model with two sets of word vectors. Each set of vectors is treated as a 'channel' and each filter is applied to both channels, but gradients are back-propagated only through one of the channels. Hence the model is able to fine-tune one set of vectors while keeping the other static. Both channels are initialized with word2vec.# text-classification-cnn

## Quick Start


To run the model on [SST-1] dataset on [multichannel](Model Type), just run the following code.

```
python train.py --mode multichannel
```

The file will be saved in 

```
saves/best_model.pt
```

To test the model, you can use the following command.

```
python main.py --trained_model saves/best_model.pt --mode multichannel
```



## Dataset and Embeddings 
- Dataset is in data repo. You can set your own path in *SST1.py* and *args.py* for data and embeddings.

We experiment the model on the following three datasets.

- SST-1: Keep the original splits and train with phrase level dataset and test on sentence level dataset.

## Setting

Adadelta is used for training. 

## Training Time

For training time, when

```
torch.backends.cudnn.deterministic = True
```

is specified, the training will be ~3h because deterministic cnn algorithm is used (accuracy v.s. speed).

Other option is that

```
torch.backends.cudnn.enabled = False
```
but this will take ~6-7x training time.

## Results

Deterministic Algorithm for CNN.

## TODO

- More experiments on SST-2 and subjectivity
- Parameters tuning
